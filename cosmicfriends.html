        <!-- STORY -->
        <section id="story">
            <h2>How the Cosmic Crew Came Together</h2>
            <p>It all started at the <a href="https://starwalk.space/en/news/what-is-space">Galactic Academy of Exploration</a>, a prestigious space institute orbiting the neutral moon of Zephara. Every cycle, the Academy hosted the Interplanetary Exchange Program, inviting young explorers from across the galaxy to train together in diplomacy, survival, and starship piloting.</p>

            <ul><!--bold <b> vs strong <strong> es la que deberia de usar para accesibility-->
                <li> <b>Nariko</b> arrived from Verdara with a backpack full of homemade gadgets and a dream of mapping the uncharted nebulae.</li>
                <li> <strong>Jax</strong>, Earth’s loudest and proudest recruit, was more interested in the Academy’s zero-gravity skatepark than its lectures.</li>
                <li> <strong>Ariya</strong>, quiet and observant, came from Lunara to study cosmic phenomena and ancient star languages.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> 
               They were assigned to the same dorm pod—Unit 7B—and at first, it was chaos. Jax’s music clashed with Ariya’s meditation rituals, and Nariko kept rewiring the pod’s lighting system to simulate Verdaran sunsets.
            </p>
            <p> <!--<i> vs <em> emphasis-->
            But everything changed during the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_survival">Academy’s annual Asteroid Survival Simulation</a></em>. Their pod was dropped on a rogue asteroid and told to survive for 72 hours with limited supplies. While other teams panicked, these three found their rhythm:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Nariko built a solar-powered shelter from scrap metal.</li>
                <li>Ariya deciphered the asteroid’s magnetic field to locate safe zones.</li>
                <li>Jax kept morale high, cracking jokes and rallying the team through meteor showers.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                They not only survived—they thrived. And when they returned, they were offered a real mission: a ship of their own, and a license to explore the galaxy together. 
                Thus, The Crescent Nomad was born—and so was their legendary friendship.</p>

        <!-- ADVENTURE -->
        <section id="adventure">
            <h2>The Echo Crystals of Virellon</h2>
            <p>While charting the uninhabited moon of Virellon, the trio stumbles upon a cave filled with glowing crystals that emit sound — not just any sound, but echoes of memories. Each crystal plays back moments from the past of whoever touches it.
            Nariko hears her first flight test on Verdara, Jax relives a childhood moment with his sister on Earth, and Ariya listens to the lullabies sung by her lunar mentor. But then, the crystals begin to harmonize — forming a melody that opens a hidden chamber.
            Inside, they find a map etched in light, pointing to a lost planet rumored to hold the secrets of time travel. The friends exchange wide-eyed glances. Their next adventure just found them. </p>

        </section>

        <!-- SHIP -->
        <section id="ship">
            <h2>Their Ship: The Crescent Nomad</h2>
            <p>A sleek, silver spacecraft shaped like a crescent moon, equipped with:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Panoramic dome cockpit</li>
                <li>Glowing blue thrusters</li>
            </ol>
<p>it’s fast, stealthy, and perfect for spontaneous detours through wormholes.
